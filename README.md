You are turning into a worm monster, have been kidnapped and put into a mysterious laboratory, and now you need to escape. Dodge scientists to try and escape from the lab while grappling with your mortality and the impermanence of human connection. Collect mutagens to augment your abilities that will help you in your escape attempt.

Controls: WASD or Arrow keys to move, use Left Mouse Button to click on the inventory button and open the inventory.
